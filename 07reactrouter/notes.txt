 What This Code Does
<NavLink> is a component from React Router, used to navigate between routes.

It receives a className as a function that takes isActive (boolean) â€” true if the current route matches the link.
Dynamic Class Based on Active Route
If this NavLink is the current route, it uses:

text-orange-700 (highlight color)

Otherwise, it shows:

text-gray-700 (normal text)
