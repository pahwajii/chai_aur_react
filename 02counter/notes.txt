1. Syntax Recap
jsx
Copy code
const [stateVariable, setStateFunction] = useState(initialValue);
useState() is a React (or Preact) hook used to manage local component state.

Returns an array:

stateVariable: the current state value

setStateFunction: the function used to update it

🔹 2. Your Code Example
jsx
Copy code
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
count is the state variable initialized to 0.

setCount is the function that can update the count.

This could be used in future to track clicks, members, or any dynamic UI behavior.

🔹 3. Common Use Cases for useState
Toggle UI elements

Store form inputs

Manage counters or scores

Trigger re-render on state change

Control component conditions (like showing/hiding components)

🔹 4. Example Usage (hypothetical)
If you wanted to use count to track how many cards were rendered:

jsx
Copy code
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

<Card onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
<p>You clicked on {count} cards.</p>
This would increment the count whenever a card is clicked.

🔹 5. Rules of useState
Can only be used inside React/Preact function components

Must be called at the top level (not inside loops or conditions)

You can have multiple useState hooks in one component

🔹 6. When to Use useState vs Props
Feature	useState	props
Owned by component	✅ Yes	❌ No
Passed from parent	❌ No	✅ Yes
Used to trigger re-render	✅ Yes	❌ No
Used to receive static input	❌ No	✅ Yes
