React Team Cards Component – Notes
1. `useState` Hook
- `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)` declares a state variable named `count`.
- Although `count` is not used in the UI, it can be expanded later for interaction.
2. JSX Layout and Design
- A heading `<h1>` is styled using Tailwind CSS with gradient text, bounce animation, shadow, and responsiveness.
- Useful for creating eye-catching titles.
3. `Card` Component Usage
- The `Card` component is imported and reused with different props for each team member.
- Props used: `username`, `testboxtxt`, `member`, and `img`.
- Helps in rendering a clean, reusable profile card for each individual.
- Keeps UI modular and maintainable.
4. Image Prop (`img`)
- Each card passes an image name as a prop. Example: `img="IMG_8504.JPG"`.
- Assumes images are stored in the `public` folder or statically imported in the `Card` component.
5. Reusability and Scaling
- Instead of hardcoding cards, an array of objects (team members) can be mapped to `<Card />` components for cleaner code.
- Example: `team.map(member => <Card {...member} />)`.

1. Functional Component Structure

jsx
Copy code
function Card({ username, testboxtxt, member, img }) {
  return (
    <div className="...">
      {/* JSX structure */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Card;
This is a functional React component that receives props:
username, testboxtxt, member, and img

These are used to render a custom-designed profile card

export default Card makes it available to be imported in App.jsx or other files

2. Props Explained

Prop	Description
username	The name of the member shown as the title
testboxtxt	A short message or introduction under the name
member	Tag line or number label like "Member #1", "Member #2", etc.
img	The image source for the profile picture (filename or path)

3. JSX Layout Example

jsx
Copy code
function Card({ username, testboxtxt, member, img }) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white shadow-md rounded-md p-4 text-center">
      <img
        src={`/${img}`}
        alt={username}
        className="w-32 h-32 object-cover rounded-full mx-auto"
      />
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-2">{username}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{testboxtxt}</p>
      <span className="text-xs text-gray-500">{member}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
Uses TailwindCSS for clean styling and layout

src={\/${img}`}means the image is expected from thepublic/` folder

Content is centered using text-center, with spacing using mt-2, p-4, etc.

4. Image Handling Options

Option A – Public folder (used in your project)

jsx
Copy code
<img src={`/${img}`} alt={username} />
Put images inside the public/ folder (e.g., public/IMG_8504.JPG)

Then pass just the filename as prop: img="IMG_8504.JPG"

Option B – Static import (alternative)

jsx
Copy code
import lakshayImg from '../assets/IMG_8504.JPG';
<img src={lakshayImg} alt="Lakshay" />
Use this if you're importing images via Webpack/Vite/CRA module bundler

More reliable and type-safe in larger apps

5. Best Practices

Always add alt={username} for accessibility

When rendering multiple Card components in a loop, always use a key prop

To improve type safety, you can use PropTypes or switch to TypeScript

Example with PropTypes:

js
Copy code
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

Card.propTypes = {
  username: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  testboxtxt: PropTypes.string,
  member: PropTypes.string,
  img: PropTypes.string.isRequired
}
6. Example Usage (from App.jsx)

jsx
Copy code
<Card
  username="LAKSHAY PAHWA"
  testboxtxt="Hey, I'm Lakshay Pahwa"
  member="Member #1"
  img="IMG_8504.JPG"
/>
This renders one profile card using the Card component

Repeating this with different props displays other members

7. Optimization Tip: Dynamic Rendering with .map()

Instead of manually writing many <Card /> calls:

jsx
Copy code
const members = [
  {
    username: "LAKSHAY PAHWA",
    testboxtxt: "Hey, I'm Lakshay Pahwa",
    member: "Member #1",
    img: "IMG_8504.JPG"
  },
  {
    username: "TUSHAR SINGH",
    testboxtxt: "Hello from Tushar Singh",
    member: "Member #2",
    img: "IMG_8892.JPG"
  },
  // Add more objects...
];
You can render like this:

jsx
Copy code
{members.map((m, i) => (
  <Card
    key={i}
    username={m.username}
    testboxtxt={m.testboxtxt}
    member={m.member}
    img={m.img}
  />
))}
This is cleaner, scalable, and ideal when your data is fetched or long.
